## 1. Description

　　This forked because I want to make extension about form SUBMIT and jQuery select the elements inside the table display to the plug-in for I can make a form in the table.


## 2. Original

  You can reference to the original project https://github.com/wingmeng/fixedThead, and clap the hand for he made this plug-in.

## 3. What's the issue

　　The characteristic of this plug-in is make 4 duplicated from selected table and render it to screen. So when I kind use it with jQuery selector to each element in the table,
  it will cause the problem to the selected object, such as ONE text input element selected intention but got 4 object selected instead.
